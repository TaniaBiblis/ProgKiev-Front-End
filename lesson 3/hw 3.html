			<p class="general"><span class="firstline">Strygwyr the Bloodseeker is a melee agility hero imbued with dreadful powers</span> <br>
				to fuel violence and rip enemies apart in the heat of close combat.<span class="itext"> He can drive <br>
				targets into a maddened Bloodrage, increasing the damage of their attacks, and <br>
				allowing them to heal their wounds by killing their enemies. He can also cast <br>
				Bloodrage on himself turning him into a nuker.</span> His speed is unmatched when he <br>
				senses the blood of the dying, and from this perception none can escape. By using <br>
				Blood Rite, he can create a ritual field where his foes will be silenced and <br>
				damaged in the process. His ultimate, Rupture, sunders the skin of his victims,<br>
				causing them to trail their life force behind if they dare to flee.</p></div>

				<div> <h2>Bio and Gameplay</h2>
					<p class="general"><span class="firstline">
						Strygwyr the Bloodseeker is a ritually sanctioned hunter, Hound of the</span> <br>
						Flayed Twins, sent down from the mist-shrouded peaks of Xhacatocatl in search <br>
						of blood. The Flayed Ones require oceanic amounts of blood to keep them sated <br>
						and placated, and would soon drain their mountain empire of its populace if <br>
						the priests of the high plateaus did not appease them. <span class="btext">Strygwyr therefore goes <br>
						out in search of carnage. The vital energy of any blood he lets, flows immediately <br>
						to the Twins through the sacred markings on his weapons and armor. Over the</span> <br>
						years, he has come to embody the energy of a vicious hound; in battle he is <br>
						savage as a jackal. Beneath the Mask of the Bloodseeker, in the rush of bloody <br>
						quenching, it is said that you can sometime see the features of the Flayers <br>
						taking direct possession of their Hound.
